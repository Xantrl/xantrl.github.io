                                IaaS is a cloud computing service model that delivers fundamental infrastructure elements to consumers on-demand, over the internet, and on a pay-as-you-go basis. These
                                infrastructure elements include compute, network, storage hardware as well as other components and software. IaaS enables end users to scale and shrink resources on an as-needed
                                basis, instead of buying all the servers and equipment for storage and networking, users
                                can outsource the resource from a third-party provider, so that unnecessary infrastructure is reduced.

                                            In short, it is a back-end layer that takes care of the user’s requests.

                                Although with excellent data storage and security, there may still be emergencies
                                such as your computer crashing or unexpected power outages, Cloud-based services
                                offer data backup feature which prevents unwanted data loss.

                                To get the best reliability and performance for ones business, it’s important to have a
                                good understanding of the cloud provider, and that provider must understand the industry
                                in which you are working. Such knowledge and understanding can make a huge difference.
                                However, if the cloud carrier is able to encrypt data, they can also do the opposite, so
                                make sure that Cloud’s provider complies with privacy and security in your industry.

                                <div style="text-indent: 2.5%">Today, there is an increasing trend of cloud migration in small and large enterprises
                                as it offers near-limitless opportunities for scale and sustainability. However, it also comes
                                with a wide array of security risks that come in many forms and from both internal and
                                external sources.</div><br>
                                <div style="text-indent: 2.5%">The following are some common cloud security threats</div>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Data breaches: The expansion of cloud services comes at the cost of security, there
                                        are numerous ways that cybercriminals can do to access vulnerable and sensitive
                                        data on the cloud.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Malware injections: Another threat comes in the form of malware injection. Malicious scripts of code can be uploaded to a cloud server that hosts various applications and services. When injected, these malwares can be used to infiltrate and
                                        steal data from organizations that uses the same cloud server. A recent example is
                                        the SolarWinds hack which saw its software update injected with malware and then
                                        distributed to various US government agencies.
                                    
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): DDoS is another common form of attacks that can happen which may prevent access to the cloud servers and the data
                                        stored in them. Such delay may cause irreparable damage to the organizations that
                                        uses cloud data storage.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Malicious insiders: Insiders such as employees who have direct access to the system may intentionally steal or even allow outsiders to access the database, which
                                        poses a serious threat and may result in considerable damage if went undetected.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Insecure APIs: Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is a way for customers
                                        to access and extract information from their cloud-based services. These APIs can
                                        leak data and vulnerable to attacks from outsiders if not properly configured.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Account hijacking: Accounts that was granted access to the system can be compromised. Sophisticated tools and phishing schemes are used to hijack cloud accounts
                                        and gain access to sensitive business data.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
