                <div class="content">
                    <div>The advent of Cloud Computing has been changing not only in the Information Technology field but also in many aspects of the modern world. The invention of Internet and
                    the rapid evolution of digital device together with Cloud Computing has made the world
                    "flatter". Communication becomes easier, the way we work is more different. Improved
                    connectivity and processing means enhanced collaboration, increased productivity. Cloud
                    computing has, therefore, changed the business world by replacing the traditional on-site
                    processes with high computing power with greater information and data access, promoting cooperation and sharing infrastructure for more efficiency. Moreover, it created a level
                    field on the Internet for various industries and sectors, hence, the business world became
                    more competitive, and competition means development.
                    <br> Cloud computing is undoubtedly
                    one of the most significant pillar in the IT sector, throughout its history, it has grown
                    to form a virtual globalization model and it will continue to evolve. As of right now, the
                    rapid transition from the traditional IT systems to the cloud systems is on the rise all
                    over the world and in nearly all aspects of the modern society.

        <h1>SERVERLESS MODEL</h1>
        <div class="article">

                <div class="content">
                    <div>Serverless computing has been one of the most discussed movement in the IT worldrecently. The serverless architecture itself is a cloud-based computational platform, whichoffers FaaS (Functions as a Service), a simpler version of PaaS. In simple technical terms,the serverless model offers developers a quick way to deploy applications and systemswithout concern for the server-side configurations. All the back-end logic are processedon servers owned by cloud providers. One of the major serverless technology provider isAWS Lambda, which is being adopted by a wide range of businesses.</div>

                <div class="content">
                    <div>Take Coca-colaâ€™s vending machines for example, the purchase processing goes entirely
                    through third-party services from processing payment to handling the back-end logic,
                    which is done by AWS Lambda. <br>
                    The serverless architecture also represents a better alternative than the traditional
                    servers in mobile apps and websites since the technology allows for scalability depending
                    on traffic, ease of server management and fast development. More importantly, the billing
                    of the service is based on the resources used.</div>

                    <div>Clearly, adopting the serverless infrastructure has various benefits from the economic
                    standpoint. As major businesses like Netflix has been migrating to serverless, many will
                    follow and the implementation of serverless model is likely to wide spread in the near
                    future.</div>

                    automated network of IoT devices can be efficiently connected and controlled. Moreover,
                    incorporating AI technology opens up a wide array of applications that can either replace
                    existing technical solutions or present a new path.<br>
                    With the help of AI and ML, which allows for highly efficient coordination among
