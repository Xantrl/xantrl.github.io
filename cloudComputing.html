                    The advent of Cloud Computing has been changing not only in the Information Technology field but also in many aspects of the modern world. The invention of Internet and
                    the rapid evolution of digital device together with Cloud Computing has made the world
                    "flatter". Communication becomes easier, the way we work is more different. Improved
                    connectivity and processing means enhanced collaboration, increased productivity. Cloud
                    computing has, therefore, changed the business world by replacing the traditional on-site
                    processes with high computing power with greater information and data access, promoting cooperation and sharing infrastructure for more efficiency. Moreover, it created a level
                    field on the Internet for various industries and sectors, hence, the business world became
                    more competitive, and competition means development. Cloud computing is undoubtedly
                    one of the most significant pillar in the IT sector, throughout its history, it has grown
                    to form a virtual globalization model and it will continue to evolve. As of right now, the
                    rapid transition from the traditional IT systems to the cloud systems is on the rise all
                    over the world and in nearly all aspects of the modern society.

            <h1>SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE</h1>
            <div class="article">

                        Serverless computing has been one of the most discussed movement in the IT world recently.
                        The serverless architecture itself is a cloud-based computational platform, which offers
                        FaaS (Functions as a Service), a simpler version of PaaS. In simple technical terms, the
                        serverless model offers developers a quick way to deploy applications and systems without
                        concern for the server-side configurations. All the back-end logic are processed on servers
                        owned by cloud providers. One of the major serverless technology provider is AWS Lambda,
                        which is being adopted by a wide range of businesses.

                    Take Coca-cola's vending machines for example, the purchase processing goes entirely through
                    third-party services from processing payment to handling the back-end logic, which is done
                    by AWS Lambda. The serverless architecture also represents a better alternative than the 
                    traditional servers in mobile apps and websites since the technology allows for scalability
                    depending on traffic, ease of server management and fast development. More importantly, the
                    billing of the service is based on the resources used.

                    Clearly, adopting the serverless infrastructure has various benefits from the economic standpoint.
                    As major businesses like Netflix has been migrating to serverless, many will follow and the implementation
                    of serverless model is likely to wide spread in the near future.

                    Another aspect that the cloud system may find itself useful is in the field of Internet of Things (IoT).
                    The cloud can support highly distributed IoT network so that a large scale automated network of IoT
                    devices can be efficiently connected and controlled. Moreover, incorporating AI technology opens up a
                    wide array of applications that can either replace existing technical solutions or present a new path.

                    The car industry is also taking notice of the possibilities that AI-powered vehicles can bring about as
                    the technology has become matured enough to be in some degree of control over a vehicle. Such embedded
                    technology with the utilization of the cloud and IoT sensors can help the vehicle navigate the traffic,
                    communicate with other vehicles and provide feedback to the cloud to train the neural network. The
                    potential that this breakthrough can produce may forever change the automobile industry in the near

                    is becoming more and more popular given the high the accuracy and speed of such technologies. Firstly,
                    utilizing the cloud with AI in dealing the heavy data flow can help medical professionals reduce the
                    workload. Moreover, clinical decisions can be made with the use of cloud-based AI imaging, which is
                    trained to identify possible tumors. Such a valuable second opinion can greatly help doctors in
                    diagnosing and providing the correct treatment.

                    However, it is very costly to establish an on-premise quantum computer so over-the-cloud quantum
                    computing services are becoming available in order to supply the demand of researchers and
                    industries that are looking for a way to create new drugs or solve optimization problems.
