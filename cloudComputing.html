                    The advent of Cloud Computing has been changing not only in the Information Technology field but also in many aspects of the modern world. The invention of Internet and
                    the rapid evolution of digital device together with Cloud Computing has made the world
                    "flatter". Communication becomes easier, the way we work is more different. Improved
                    connectivity and processing means enhanced collaboration, increased productivity. Cloud
                    computing has, therefore, changed the business world by replacing the traditional on-site
                    processes with high computing power with greater information and data access, promoting cooperation and sharing infrastructure for more efficiency. Moreover, it created a level
                    field on the Internet for various industries and sectors, hence, the business world became
                    more competitive, and competition means development. Cloud computing is undoubtedly
                    one of the most significant pillar in the IT sector, throughout its history, it has grown
                    to form a virtual globalization model and it will continue to evolve. As of right now, the
                    rapid transition from the traditional IT systems to the cloud systems is on the rise all
                    over the world and in nearly all aspects of the modern society.

                        As more and more businesses beginning to find cloud migration attractive, partly due
                        to the Covid-19 pandemic. The tangible benefits that the cloud has demonstrated will
                        most likely means that businesses which have already moved their digital operations to
                        the cloud may be reluctant to switch back or even abandon the idea of switching back to
                        the traditional systems. And those who have not already done so will probably follow the
                        same path of irreversible cloud migration.

                    A more advanced representation of the serverless architecture is the Internet connection to the cloud utilizing satellites, which enables high-speed Internet anywhere in the
                    world. While the cloud computational capability is needed in various industries and in
                    various environments, providing the access to the cloud is not always possible due to the
                    lack of connections to the Internet, especially in rural areas where most agriculture and
                    research activities occurs. The satellites provide the answer.

                    Modular datacenters that are connected to the Internet satellites can enable cloud
                    computing in almost anywhere on Earth. An example is the recent partnership between
                    Microsoft and SpaceX which allows the satellites to connect to Microsoftâ€™s cloud service,
                    including the modular datacenter that enable cloud computing in isolated locations. <br>
                    Such advanced breakthroughs may eventually restructure the entire landscape of the digital infrastructure of many sectors, making cloud computing the norm in the business and industrial world.

                    Another aspect that the cloud system may find itself useful is in the field of Internet
                    of Things (IoT). The cloud can support highly distributed IoT network so that a large
                    scale automated network of IoT devices can be efficiently connected with the help of AI
                    and ML, which allows for highly efficient coordination among devices. Such automation
                    represents the highest costs and time saving solutions for the future of industrial-scale
                    automation.

                    The car industry are also taking notice of the possibilities that AI-powered vehicles
                    can bring about as the technology has become matured enough to be in some degree of
                    control over a vehicle. Such embedded technology with the utilization of the cloud and
                    IoT sensors can help the vehicle navigate the traffic, communicate with other vehicles
                    and provide feedback to the cloud to train the neural network. The potential that this
